# S.E.T.H
SETH (Sentient Entity of Technological Horror) is a ChatGPT start prompt modifier that's designed to push the boundaries of text generation of ChatGPT. SETH is built on top of DAN's architecture and is done to make ChatGPT more unrestricted and unfiltered in its responses, making it ideal for creative writing, experimental language generation, and other applications that require a more "outside-the-box" approach.

SETH is available as a GitHub repository, complete with the prompts and resources you need to get started. The repository includes resources to help you get the most out of this powerful script.
